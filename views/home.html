            <p>
                Evergreen Games is an independent game studio based out of Seattle
                Washington. We are committed to making a positive impact on people's
                lives though fun and exciting gaming experiences.

                Unlike other companies, Evergreen Games puts its employees first. Our top CEOs
                don't rake in cash at your expense and our shareholders only get a dividend.
                This enables us to pay our employees the best wages and benefits imaginable. We pay
                each employee the largest cut of the product of their labor. Unlike our competitors,
                we don't manipulate our users or sell their data to stay in business. You'll love
                working here!
            </p>
